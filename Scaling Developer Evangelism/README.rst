Outline
============

- Intro

  - Fan Boy Time

    - Many thanks to `Evans Data`_ for having me swing by.

    - I will preface this by saying I am not paid by Evans Data whatsoever, just
      a happy customer.

    - In fact, the level of fan boy I am for this firm is Comiccon proportioned.

    - The level of fan boy I am for the research of this firm is a level I
      reserve for very, very few things.

      - The City of New York

      - Strong test coverage

      - Rehearsal

      - Punk rock

      - New England Patriots

    - No amount of money can buy the deep, deep love I have for Tom Brady.  So
      too is my affection for Evans Data.

    - The folks will tell you at Twilio, I am completely pants on head in love
      with the work of Evans Data quantifying the demography and geography of
      developers.

    - Evans Data is the Tom Brady of developer research.

  - The Reach of the Developer

    - Mostly, my fanboyism stems from the unique period in history we all
      occupy.

    - As you all know in your work day in and day out serving developer
      communities, the reach of the individual software developer is impossibly
      large

    - So large it may exceed any vocation in human history

    - The women and men who know how to write code have the ability - *right
      now* - to connect any two of the 6.8 billion people that are on this
      planet.

    - At the core of this reach is a disproportion you've heard all about today
      and will if you pick up a single thing Evans writes.

  - The Numbers of Software Eating The World

    - Right now, Evans says there are 4.6M developers in the United States

    - Constituting 18.2M developers on the planet.

    - The number of people affected by the software that they write is so
      disproportionate it is *dizzying*.

    - There are 2 billion smart phone users

    - There are 3 billion Internet users

    - There are 5 billion cell phone users.

    - All of them using software, all of it written by developers.

  - Welcome to the 1%

    - Or more precisely, the 0.2% of the planet that knows the folks who are
      writing the future for the rest of an entire planet.

    - If software is eating the world as people say, then software developers
      are the ones picking up the bill.

    - If you are in the business of serving those developers, you are in the
      only business that matters in the 21st century.

    - Business 2 Developer is not just the next hypergrowth software category

    - It is the software category that will be the one that shapes the world you
      and I live in for the rest of our lives.

    - And you, as a developer relations professional, are a part of it now.

  - Scale is the new frontier

    - Developer outreach has never been as important as it is now because
      developers have never been as important as they are now.

    - As the number of people they serve grows, so too will the importance of
      our work.

    - The days of the developer story being ancillary to a company's success are
      over.

    - Now, more than ever, the scale of our service to developers will determine
      what our future looks like.

    - Today, for the first time, Twilio would like to share what it's learned in
      the scale we've achieved in developer relations so far.

- Agenda

  - What Scale Looks Like At `Twilio`_

  - Most Important Tools For Scale

  - Common Problems

  - Thoughts About The Future

- What Scale Looks Like At `Twilio`_

  - The Developer Network

    - Twilio is a software company delivered through a web service API in the
      cloud.

    - As such, our success is predicated entirely on our developers' success.

    - Somewhat unique in the current ecosystem, our API is not an bolt-on,
      supplementary revenue stream, business expansion or after thought. 
      It is our bread and butter - the team responsible for that meal ticket at
      Twilio is the Developer Network.

    - Mission: To catalyse the network of software people who will change
      communications forever

    - Breakdown

      - We are convicted that software people - the technically minded set of engineers,
        architects, sysadmins, and product owners - are going to change the way
        you and I communicate for the rest of our lives and that possibility is
        right here, right now.

      - They are most powerful when they are connected together as a critical
        mass of talented individuals who create a defensible network effect.

      - With a service like Twilio, we feel they have this capability already -
        our job on the Developer Network is to serve them in such a way that
        ability is self-discovered and sustained in their development as the
        architects of our future.

  - Funnel Model

    - Common to sales and marketing - appears to be the primary lens through
      which a business is viewed.

    - Some set of people focused on Awareness and Understanding

    - Another set of people focused on driving Understanding to Adoption

      - Documentation or technical writing

      - Training, in person or online

      - Often outsourced, frequently with poor results

    - Another pulling that Adoption to Activation

      - Often Social / Community management

      - Some organization include pre- or post- sale support

  - Network Model

    - A thought model oriented around sales is going to produce an action model
      oriented around the same.

    - In this model, developers are treated as a means, rather than an end.

    - An alternate approach - the approach we take at Twilio - trades creating
      moments where purchasers can say yes to a deal for occassions where
      developers learn to do something they didn't know they could do before.

    - This is a network model which powers the mission of our developer
      outreach.

    - There is a constellation of developers out there

    - And we want to introduce this Big Idea called Twilio

      - Twilio the Company

      - Twilio the Product

      - Twilio the Brand

    - Instead of layers of a funnel, Twilio focuses on three halos of this 
      network

      - Developer Evangelism

        - On the outermost limits of the network, we have a team of devangels

        - Mission: To inspire and equip developers to change communications
          forever

        - They focus on connecting with developers individually and introducing
          them to the Big Idea called Twilio

        - They go to where those developers live online and off, effectively
          creating the edge of the graph of developers who are aware and
          understand Twilio

        - The breadth and depth of Twilio's reach is their responsibility.
          Wherever we reach a new geography or demography, that unit is
          responsible for serving those developers.

      - Developer Education

        - Closer to the center of the network is our second halo, Developer
          Education.

        - Mission: To challenge and empower Twilio developers to change
          communications at their business forever.

        - If devangels get developers started with Twilio, educators get
          developers finished with Twilio.

        - High quality technical content that takes a developer who has made
          their first call or message with Twilio through to deploying real code
          in production.

        - Through that education, they create thicker, stronger connections
          between the Big Idea called Twilio and the developers in the network

        - In so doing, the frequency and fidelty of those connections pull the
          network tighter together, projecting an ever growing moat around the
          business.

        - The two teams working in tandem hopefully produce a moment where the
          developer learns something he or she didn't know he or she could do
          before.

        - For most of us, we can immediately think of one of those
          teachers now and the strong bonds that were created as the result of
          learning to do something new.  

        - Audience: Did anyone have an influential teacher in their education or
          career?

          - Who was it?

          - Often, when you mention it to other people what they taught you
            immediately springs to mind.

          - These bonds are unique to humanity and the ones we try to create
            with this network model.

      - Developer Community

        - The last halo in that model is at the network's core, the Developer Community team.

        - Mission: To propel developers to change communications together.
    
        - Thinking back to those teachers that were influential to you - I'm
          probably not the first person you told about him/her, am I?

        - Indeed not - often the first impulse after acquiring a new ability
          is to tell everyone you know about it, particularly if it is as
          superheroic as those found in programming.
          
        - The Community team is focused on helping you share those new abilities
          with the world.

        - If the education pieces the team produces increase the frequency and
          fidelity of connections with the Big Idea called Twilio, the Community
          team aims to increase the frequency and fidelity of connections among
          the developers themselves.

        - And hopefully over time if we do that work at a level of excellence,
          those connections will grow and include developers we never would have
          reached on our own.

        - Indeed, the depth and breadth of the network because force multiplied,
          creating a far greater defensible effect that we could have achieved
          on our own.

    - Network as Architecture, Community as Cloud

      - Audience: When the halos of this network model are combined, what do
        they end up looking like?

      - It looks very much like a cloud - a distributed network of interacting,
        but independent nodes that together create something more powerful than
        they could ever be alone.

      - This is no accident - Twilio the Ecosystem is architected with the same
        distributed, decentralized, network-drive philosophy as Twilio the
        Product.

      - And it is in that distribution that the ability to scale becomes real,
        whether you're moving minutes, messages or memories.

- Most Important Tools For Scale

  - Measurement

    - The Number 1 question I get asked by peers or candidates looking at
      developer outreach as a career or strategy is "what defines success?"

    - This is particularly important for engineers, who have built careers
      moving user stories from sprint to sprint.

    - A lot of folks place the evangelism piece (which serves as only one part
      of Twilio's overall network approach) in particular like a field
      marketing organization, which appears to be an unsolved marketing
      problem.

    - Three Challenges

      - Difficulty of measurement

        - The metrics that matter - e.g. lifecycle events and API usage - are
          often locked behind production interfaces that are difficult to
          access.

        - Getting these results is not often timely for an individual
          interacting with the developer network in real time.

        - Few engineering organization prioritize access to this information.

      - Replacement with vanity metrics

        - Tracking how many projects got built at a hackathon is next to
          useless.

        - Sure is way easier than figuring out how many people signed up at a
          hackathon, even with promo codes.

        - The easy things to measure often produce the wrong behaviors for
          network growth.

      - Measurement is latent and inaccurate

        - Because this is difficult, measurement often only comes at a
          quarterly, or worse, basis.

        - These reports are loaded with facts and figures that have low
          actionability.

        - The edge of the network becomes unlikely to retain the measurement
          or use it as an instrument to guide execution.

    - Three Solutions

      - Beg, steal or borrow data

        - There is probably useful data in the tools you already have.

        - A lot of power in free tools like Google Analytics and social media
          services.

        - Three beers with the tech lead for your billing service can often
          be more valuable than three meetings with your VP of engineering.

        - The captain of any good ship has to engage in some piracy every now
          and again - no one is going to give you the data you need, you have
          to get it.

      - Find the right lens

        - Zipcodes are functionally worthless. The audience is too mobile and
          skews suburban to limit your scope to cities only.

        - States/Provinces are too noisy - discerning your field work's
          effectiveness is impossible from the overal progress of the
          business.

        - Borrow from Don Draper - the Designated Market Area is a useful
          instrument.

        - Example: Recent hackathon performance based on city, then based on
          DMA.

      - Push persistence to the edge.

        - Centralizing reporting into a single person or job function shreds
          the effectiveness those serving your network.

        - Like in a distributed service, the relevant data to make smart
          application decisions must be pushed to the edge.

        - Every last person on your crew needs access to every last report you
          generate.

        - We've developed a few tools for this:

          - Trip report

          - Metro ownership

          - Data tools training part of onboarding

          - Using `Net Promoter Score`_ to gauge depth of touch. Developers
            are notoriously loathe to recommend anything - strong NPS scores
            are a reasonable measurement of the network effect we're trying to
            create.

      - Good numbers are better than perfect numbers - YoY growth for most of
        your metrics will tell you a lot.

  - Content

    - Balancing your online and offline outreach is very difficult to do.

    - Every developer outreach program struggles with balancing the online and
      offline experiences for your developers.

    - Documentation is the most important product you ship.

      - At Twilio, this starts from the very beginning.

      - Any product at Twilio begins its life as documentation.

      - The developer will be spending five times as much time reading your
        documentation than reading the responses from your API.

      - Optimizing for that experience in your developer outreach is critical
        for scale.

    - Technical content is the economy of scale for developer outreach

      - Or, to put it another way, the meetup you don't have to leave your
        house to go to every month.

      - Case study: Tessel Sleep Tracker

        - Developer evangelist `Ricky Robinett`_  has an adorable dog, Gif
          whose utility on this Internet is boundless.

        - Gif is a Pomeranian that is probably the most stoked dog on the
          planet, to the degree that it has spawned its own `parody Twitter
          account`_.
          
        - For a talk at `Brooklyn.JS`_ he showed a little `Tessel`_ hack he
          did to track the dog's sleep. wrote a piece on the
          `Tessel`_ Internet of Things platform for his adorable dog, Gif.
        
        - In concert, he wrote a `JavaScript tutorial describing how to build it`_.

        - Talk, naturally, was a big hit: +55.9 NPS with 36 responses from a
          70 person crowd.

        - Blog post is also a reasonable base hit, getting a good 1.5k user
          pop from social media.

        - But the real victory were the months that followed - that post
          continues to average 125 visitors a month at 5x the site average
          time on page.

        - So basically every month getting twice the exposure of the meetup
          for the same amount of effort.

        - Obviously, the depth of those touches are unlikely to be the same,
          but by doing both the talk and the blog post, Ricky achieved breadth
          and depth of touch for the same piece of content.

      - Often, developer outreach programs either do one or the other.

      - The wisdom of Aristotle prevails here - balance is key to achieving
        scale.

    - Big wins

      - `Teaching a dog to take selfies`_

      - `New product categories get introduced`_

        - Text 'iphone', 'android' or 'windows' to (979) 272-6399.

        - Whole new idea that came from content work.

      - Single biggest driver of new traffic to twilio.com outside the home
        page - if we don't publish another piece the rest of the year, the
        Google juice will get us halfway to new customer goal.

  - Training

    - Hiring Funnel

      - Hiring is the most difficult part of running a developer outreach
        program.

      - First of all, look at the numbers of developers - even in the two
        countries Evans projects are growing double digits, the demand is
        outstripping the supply.

      - From that, reduce by the amount of people who are not paralytically
        afraid of public speaking which some psychologists put as high as 75%.

      - Of those, reduce by the number of people who take joy from the success
        of others than themselves.

      - And then have the domain expertise for your particular technology.

      - The 1% quickly becomes the 0.0001%

    - Retention 

      - If hiring is this difficult, developing and retaining your talent
        becomes paramount.

      - The track record in developer evangelism is not great here.

      - When I first took the job, everyone told me you could only do this job
        for a year.

      - This is straight-up *bullshit*.

    - Training Is How You Keep People

      - There are few silver bullets in the devrel game - training your people
        is absolutely one of them.

      - 3 years ago at Twilio, the longest anyone had served as a developer
        evangelist was a year and a day.

      - Today, 75% of the team has been with the crew over 1 year.

      - Over half have been with the crew over two.

      - There is no secret here - training works.

    - The Developer Network's Training Program

      - If you aren't spending 20% of your time and treasure on developing
        your team, you are going to be spending 40% on recruiting.

      - Team

        - Quarterly Summits for each team

        - Everyone in one place at one time to spend half the time talking
          strategy, half the time working on our craft.

        - Not presentations, facilitated discussions where everyone is around
          a table and everyone is called to serve to facilitate a discussion.

        - At least 8 days of team building per year

        - Quarterly cadence is hard to commit to as team grows, but absolutely
          essential.

        - If we only did this, we'd be 80% of the way to where we are.

      - Individual

        - At least 5 days of external technical training

        - Gain insights from outside the bubble of the business.

        - Can't recommend `Big Nerd Ranch`_ enough.

      - Peer-to-Peer

        - At least one opportunity a month.

        - Demojam - single day training sessions on public speaking that are
          peer led.

        - Tuneups - Google Hangouts for writing or public speaking

        - Content Review - voice and technical before anything ships

        - Worked / !Worked on everything.
       
    - This is the closest thing you will ever get to a universal solution to
      anything in developer relations.  You will never achieve scale without
      intentional, comprehensive training. 

- Common Problems 

  - Personnel

    - Nothing is as effective to bringing a developer into your network than
      introducing them to another developer.

    - Many of you know this already, developers don't want to talk to
      marketers, they want to talk to other developers.

    - Real network scale is achieved through vast webs of peer-to-peer
      connections - this needs to be as true for the nodes within your company
      as without

    - Frequently, developer outreach programs will put a bigger premium on
      soft skills than hard skills.

    - Or, even more dangerously, will try to use salespeople instead.

    - There's no way around it - this audience views technical ability as a
      Boolean condition.

    - "Good enough to be dangerous" works when you're selling guitars or
      tires, but not APIs.

    - What We Look For

      - Technical Credibility - real engineers

      - Empathy

      - Patience

      - Resiliency

      - Hustle

    - You will - and *should* - have non-technical people serving in your
      developer outreach in a number of critical capacities in your program.

    - But, for the core experience, the more times you have your audience
      connecting with actual developers that can meet them as peers, the
      greater scale you will achieve.

  - Burnout

    - Single biggest problem in developer outreach

    - Engineers are not naturally nomadic

    - You can speak at 5 conference a year in basically any staff engineering
      job and get paid the same.

    - Further, all the skills that make a good developer evangelist make a
      lock as a fundable cofounder.

    - In Silicon Valley in particular, we lose more candidate to their own
      entrepreneurial ambition than to competitive offers.

    - Our solutions

      - Direct flights

      - Content balance

      - Unlimited PTO - these are usually bullshit, you have to lead by
        example here.

      - Metro focus

  - Wrong Problems

    - Audience: What is the #1 question you get from someone entering
      developer relations for the first time?

    - Mine is "Which events should I be going to?"

    - Of the million things that you need to think about in your developer
      outreach, it is super easy to focus on things that have nothing to do
      with serving your developers well.

    - There are some recurring themes I often hear folks struggle with -
      avoiding them is key to achieving scale.

    - The worst of the wrong problems to focus on

      - Picking Events

        - Your evangelists already know which events are the important ones

        - If they don't, the developers you serve definitely do.

        - Asking them will get you further than asking anyone at this
          conference.

        - You'll find out real fast what kind of events work for your product.

      - Reaching the Enterprise

        - This is perhaps the most mystifying question I'll hear folks ask.

        - Usually it is something to the effect of, "So, we went to some
          hackathons - but how do we get into the enterprise developer?"

          - As if the "enterprise developer" is some alien creature that is
            difficult to reach.

          - Developers are developers, regardless of whether they wear a hoodie
            to work or not.

          - They do consume different media, they use different technologies, they
            go to different events, and perhaps look at their job differently.

          - But they still learned to code because they love technology and
            making things work.

          - They still have the same reaction when you make your phone ring as
            anyone else.

          - The only thing that changes is the context in which that moment
            happens, and finding that is one of the easiest things you'll do:

          - ASK THEM.

        - Production Metrics

          - "How many events should I do a month?" is not the right question.

          - The right question is "how many developers can I serve this week?"

          - We didn't do 528 events because it met a quota. We felt we had 528
            opportunities to serve developers at a level of excellence.

          - There are way more meetups, conferences, hackathons, maker faires,
            startup weekends, examples, tutorials, quickstart guides and blog
            posts than you could ever possibly do.

          - Focusing on what you do instead of how you did is the fastest way to
            burn out your crew.

          - Ironically, focusing on production metrics  will also reduce your 
            production. We get more average blog posts and events per evangelist
            after we stopped basing performance off it than we did before.

          - What you measure has a dramatic effect on your team's scale.

- Thoughts About The Future

  - The formats for developer engagement will become more fuzzy and less
    important.

    - A common misconception about developer outreach is that you "go to a bunch
      of hackathons and sell your stuff."

    - "What is your hackathon strategy" itself is going to become an irrelevant
      question over time.

    - The data suggests more and more developers over time are viewing
      programming less as a vocation and more as a lifestyle choice.

    - This is accelerating the fastest in APAC.

    - The developer events of the future are going to reflect more of this
      lifestyle bent.

    - I feel like I've been on an email thread predicting the end of the
      hackathon every six months for the past seven years.

    - No one knows when or if the hackathon is going to end

    - When is almost important - what is clear is that developers are going to
      figure out more events themselves that blur the line between vocation and
      avocation.

    - The winning programs will be those that figure out a way to serve those
      developers well regardless of format.

  - Talent is going to become a lot harder to acquire.

    - Three Big Pressures

      - If you know how to code, starting a company costs less than the iPad you
        gave away at your last hackathon.

      - If you know how to code, raising seed money for a company takes less time
        than to get a candidate through the interview process.

      - If you know how to code, OMG PLEAZE WORK FOAR ME!!!11

    - Hiring is going to be the most important discipline for leaders of
      developer outreach programs to develop.

    - Who has the strongest technical talent will ultimately win.

  - What comes first is going to be what lasts.

    - Lot of folks talk about the dominance of companies whose products started
      as mobile apps first and have tried to apply to developer tools.

    - Companies like Twilio often get cited as examples of this, but I don't
      think that's where the real edge comes from.

    - In the developer space, the ones that are going to win are
      documentation-first.

    - A product engineering process that starts with documentation is absolutely
      irreplacable in terms of developer adoption.

    - Every time we stray from this mantra, we end up regretting it.

    - The products that are going to win in the B2D category are going to be
      documentation first.

- Conclusions

  - There are 18.2M developers in the world...

  - Writing software for 6.8B people on the planet.

  - The scale of the developer's reach is unprecedented.

  - This is driving the scale of developer relations to be unprecedented.

  - These were a few things we learned through reaching that scale.

  - I want to learn more about what that journey has been like for you.

  - Outro

    - Jobs
