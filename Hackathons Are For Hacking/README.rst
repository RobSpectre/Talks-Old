Hackathons Are For Hacking
***************

Observations on hackathon activity trends from a frequent sponsor.

Given at `Hackcon`_ 2015.


Outline
===========

- Intro

  - Name is borrowed from `a piece by Cassidy Williams`_.

  - While her post is a thoughtful piece about the challenges a young woman
    faces in this business, this talk is about the business that a sponsor has
    at a hackathon in the first place.

  - The statement is simple but powerful. "Hackathons are for hacking." It got
    me to thinking why I ever got involved in hackathons in the first place.

  - The first time I made it into WIRED magazine was a hackathon.

  - What I wanted to do was build some shit.

  - Hackathons are not for selling.

  - Hackathons are for hacking.

  - And at least for a company like `Twilio`_, that is good business.

  - Intro

    - Bio

    - `Twilio`_

    - Agenda

      - Why `Twilio`_ sponsors hackathons

      - Hackathon activites that did work

      - Conclusion

- Hackathon Trends

  - We keep talking about whether or not we've reached peak hackathon

  - In fact, predicting the death of the hackathon is a thread that pops up on
    one email list I'm on or another every six months or so.

  - The raw number continues to grow, though few people have that data

  - It is unclear if we will reach a point where the numbers of hackathons
    will exceed the amount of sponsorship dollars available.

  - It is very clear however we will reach a maximum for the number of attendees

  - In the Western world, the number of new developers each year is growing at a
    lethargic 2-3%.

  - There will be a "poker" moment of saturation.  Not because of sponsorship
    interest, but because of attendee interest.

  - I don't think anyone knows when that day is going to be.

  - But, the collegiate hackathon scene is certainly feeling that pressure.
    There are a limited number of viable weekends in a school year, a more
    limited number of organization hours you can spend putting on these events,
    and holy-shit-biscuits-on-a-pancake way more limited folks that can attend.

  - That is causing everyone to try to differentiate with different activities
    to boost draw.

  - We see a lot of those activities at `Twilio`_ by virtue of the scale of our
    operation.

  - Most of them aren't great.

  - Pony rides

- Sponsorship Opportunities Compared

  - What we do on the crew I serve at `Twilio`_ is build a network.

  - Take a group of hackers, drop in `Twilio`_ and a developer evangelist and
    empower him or her to make as many connections as possible between the
    individual devangel and `Twilio`_.

  - Awareness

    - Premium branding available for a premium price

    - For example, let's say Hackcon Powered By `Twilio`_

    - That can produce a higher number of connections to `Twilio`_ than a
      devangel can get on his/her own.

    - It does not, however, create a meaningful connection between `Twilio`_ and
      the developer.

  - Giveaways

    - Another incentive is a big prize - let's say a new iPad or fat stacks of
      cash money.

    - That creates another dynamic that makes for poor network building.

    - The incentive is stronger so the connections are stronger, but only for a
      certain segment of the audience that is into whatever it is you're giving
      away.

    - Astonishingly, cash underindexes for the developer as a motivator and
      many of them already have iPads

    - So you're already getting fewer people's attention than the awareness
      play.

    - At the end of the event, the network effect is a trainwreck because there
      is going to be - at most! - 4-5 winners.

    - So a couple people walk away pretty stoked, but way more walk away super
      disappointed.

  - Hacking

    - Crazy idea - how about we just let them build what they want, and be there
      to help them with any technical problems they have

    - Psychologically, branding and incentives do work to a certain degree.
      There are plenty of studies out there that talk about the effect that
      these traditional marketing methods have.

    - But nothing - nothing - I have seen creates a stronger connection between
      both an individual and a brand than showing someone how to do something
      they didn't know they could do before.

    - It is in your life right now.  How many of you had an influential teacher
      in your life so far?  What was his/her name?

    - For those of you who have participated in hackathons, how many of you had
      a developer evangelist help you do something you didn't know how to do
      before? What was his/her name?  Where did he/she work?

    - That's what we're trying to create at `Twilio`_.

    - Because you never keep something new you learned how to do to yourself.
      You share it with a ton of people you know.

    - And that is a network effect.  And that isn't something as a sponsor I can
      ever buy.  But it is something you as an organizer can make happen more
      frequently.

- !Worked

  - Parties

  - Dancing / Yoga breaks

  - Sub 5 minute demos

  - Programming "bees" / trivia competitions

  - Workshops after the first 2 hours of hacking

  - MCing the awards / pitch mentorship

  - What is the common element?  You have to *stop* hacking.

  - Any time you're not hacking is time we don't get to help you discover
    something new.

- Worked

  - Brain Trust - big neon signs pointed to evangelists who can help you with
    any problem

  - Mini-hacks

  - Environment setup sessions at the start of the hackathon

  - Live coding demos

  - Technical gates on freebie distribution

  - What is the common element? You have to *keep* hacking.

  - Any time you're hacking, we're here to serve you.

- Conclusion

  - Cassidy hit it spot on.  Hackathons are indeed for hacking.

  - The more time you spend hacking, the more opportunity for the real
    connections between evangelists and brand grows.

  - Those connections form the basis of a network effect that can breed real
    commercial success

  - I hope when you have ideas on how to keep hackers hacking at your events,
    you'll hit me up to talk about them.
