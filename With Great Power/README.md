# With Great Power...

An inspirational talk on the reach available to every programmer in the World
and the responsibility that demands.

Given at [Hackference 2015](http://2015.hackference.co.uk/) in Birmingham,
England.


## Outline

- Intro
  - Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to live in New York
  - Mostly because of comic books
  - Unlike their [Distinguished Competition](http://www.dccomics.com/), I read
    Marvel Comics because their "heroes" were real people in real places.
  - Marvel heroes weren't born to be super and didn't always do the right thing
  - They were deeply flawed normals who were always placed in an extraordinary
    circumstance beyond their choosing.
  - They also were grappling with their circumstances in real places. They
    weren't in Metropolis or Gotham or Delta City.
  - They were in Los Angeles, Boston and New York.
  - The lessons they learned through pain were real
  - Spider-man was one I gravitated to immediately.
    - He was a geek who had a tough time at school
    - A natural gift set him apart from others and gave him the ability to do
      things incredible and lucrative.
    - He got so caught up in his newfound capability that he began to become
      self-absorbed.
    - So self-absorbed he would only use that ability to benefit himself.
    - Which would be a life choice he would come to regret.
  - Spider-man would go on to spend the next sixty years slinging web through
    the streets of New York in a journey of redempetion.
  - Not only would the scenery inspire me to make my home in the greatest city
    in the world, but the story would be one that would be one that would have
    pronounced effect on me as I started a career in programming.
  - It's a lesson all developers would do well to learn, lest we suffer
    Spider-man's same fate
  - For make no mistake, the great power we possess carries the same
    responsibility as Spidey.

  - Outline
    - First, we need to suggest a power that is unprecedented in human history
    - Then prove that such a power is one that all developers possess
    - Then finally evidence that such unprecedented power demands unprecedented
      responsibility.
    - We're going to use comics books, history, philosophy and cut a little code
      along the way to prove that everyone in this room and every programmer in
      the world is indeed a hero.
    - And real heroes have real responsibilities.
- Unprecedented Power
  - Influence
    - One might say developers possess unprecedented influence.
    - While it seems our influence as a constituency is indeed wide, there is a
      clear winner here for occupational influence that has held the position
      for much of recorded history.
    - Hard to make an argument that any one was more influential than a pharoah.
    - Considered less kings and more living gods, their divine claim was
      thoroughly acknowledged from 3100 BC to nearly the birth of Christ.
    - Fascinatingly, their claim to unprecedented power, like developers, came
      from knowing something very specific that few others did.
    - Quite unlike the Tigris or the Euphrates or the Ilisos or the Treska, the
      Nile river ebbed and flowed on a schedule as predictable as the lunar
      cycle.
    - An early king named Menes exploited this knowledge in his bid to unify the
      fractured kingdoms surrounding the river for the first time.
    - He claimed himself the living, walking incarnation of whatever god was
      popular in the area he was making the claim.
    - He would then demonstrate the validity of this claim by accurately
      predicting on any given day how high the Nile would rise.
    - Of course, those whose power he would usurp wouldn't know that he happened
      upon a mathemetical method of accurately predicting the water's rise, but
      it only took a few times of doing this successfully before the useful
      rumor that he controlled the body of water upon which every last living
      human depended that folks were convinced of his divine claim.
    - Some compelling historical evidence exists to suggest this claim was
      thoroughly believed: the pyramids.
    - Foreman Larry does not have the influence to compel a hundred thousand
      people to build shit like that in the middle of a goddamn desert.
    - This kind of shit is built when you are convinced the dude you're talking
      to is going to take away all the *water*.
    - While there are certainly some developers you and I know who might claim
      to be gods, fortunately for us none of them possess the unique knowledge
      of the pharoah
    - Thus, we can't claim developers have the greatest influence in human
      history.
  - Wealth
    - Wealth would be another candidate for unprecedented power.
    - Certainly there is some compelling, contemporary evidence this may be so.
    - Bill Gates, a programmer, tops Forbes list of wealthiest people in the
      world and he is joined by 5 other programmers in the top 20.
    - Given contemporary income equality, adding up all the wealthiest
      programmers would likely now eclipse any other single vertical market
      (e.g. petroleum, manufacturing, telecom)
    - Tragically as mighty as developers' wealth is, that money is not
      unprecedented in human history.
    - In fact, over the past 1,000 years and adjusting for inflation a mere 3 of
      the 25 wealthiest people in human history are alive today.
    - The wealthiest person that ever lived
      - Mansa Musa of Mali from the 14th century
      - His empire spanned Ghana, Timbuktu and his home of Mali
      - Source of wealth was the production of over half of the gold and salt
        mined in the 14th century
      - Adjusted for inflation his fortune was 264 billion pounds - compared to
        a mere 89 for Bill Gates at the height of his fortune in 1999.
    - Certainly anyone here will tell you programming is indeed a lucrative
      career, but unfortunately appears West African miners have us beat.
  - Other possibilities?
    - We have a developer giving a shot at politics in the US - we'll see how
      that turns out with McAfee 2016
    - Exploration - unfortunately rockets appear to be harder to make than first
      person shooters
    - Rock stars - still doesn't seem to be working out for me.
  - Reach
    - I'd argue the power that is unprecedented in human history for developers
      is reach.
    - Software has spread to more people than anything that has happened before
    - People talk about this in incomprehensible ways - thousand percent growth,
      trillions of messages per second
    - Let us consider PHP alone
    - Say what you want about the language, but you're using it every day -
      whether you want to or not.
    - Add up Facebook, Yahoo and Wikipedia and that's 2.1 billion people
      visiting it every month.
    - Facebook has a billion people using it actively.
    - The last time a billion people were active in anything it was Islam.
    - The time before that was Christianity.
    - I can tell you the latter was definitely not "opt-in"
    - Think about that people - it is absolutely staggering in human history
    - PHP is *literally* more popular than Jesus.
- Unprecedented Reach
  - We have a compelling argument that *some* developers have the greatest reach
    humanity has ever seen.
  - What we don't have is an argument that *all* developers have it.
  - Those developers that reached more users than the major world religions had
    to have had some ability that I don't have.
  - I'm going to make the bold claim that is not true.
  - The tools and services that are available to developers right now have made
    each of you capable of reaching billions of people around the world.
  - It doesn't require any other skill than the one you've already developed.
  - Live Coding
    - Video endpoint on laptop
    - Video endpoint on smart device
    - Make them talk
    - SMS in
    - Call out
  - From empty files in a little more than ten minutes we just demonstrated the
    capacity to reach over 6 billion people on the planet over video, audio and
    text message.
  - What is missing 
- Great Responsibility
  - That's a pretty amazing capacity we have
  - And a pretty spooky one at the same time
  - History suggests great power usually doesn't work out great for the wielder.
    - Eventually Macedonians would arrive educated in the same science that
      predicted the Nile's rise and fall, crushing the rule of the pharoahs.
    - Manusa Masa died young, his wealth widdled to a third of its size after the
      ensuing civil wars in a single generation.
    - John McAfee ended up becoming John McAfee
  - History alone won't lead us to a more fortunate path.
  - We can turn to philosophy - Immanuel Kant
  - Categorical Imperative
    - Act as though the maxim of every action could be applied as a universal
      law
    - Sounds a lot like the Golden Rule you may have learned in grammar school
    - But it is a philosophy that works at the scale of a developer's reach.
    - Kingdom of Ends
  - If we're being honest, a lot of what we choose to work on is not building a
    Kingdom of Ends
    - Liquid meals that exploit our industriousness so we can spend more time
      working
    - Sharing apps that exploit our vanity so we can spend more time viewing the
      lives we lead through a screen
    - Rating apps that exploit our schaudefreude ruining the reputation of
      others for the entertainment value
    - Any of the multitude of "sharing economy" clones aiming to solve every
      First World Problem left in the San Francisco Bay Area
    - They are beneath us.
    - They are beneath the people that wield the greatest reach humanity has
      ever seen.
  - Name a constituency that gained unprecedented power in the whole of human history and the
    only ones that didn't descend into complete ruin in a generation's time were
    the ones who exercised a philosophy predicated on serving their communities.
  - This weekend as you wield that power, I would encourage you to think about
    the responsibility that power bears.
  - What you build should be worth of this supernatural ability
    - If it is fun, it should be fun for everyone.
    - If it is funny, it should be funny for everyone.
    - If it is useful, it should be useful for everyone.
    - If it is beautiful, it should be beautiful for everyone.
    - For if you build this weekend with the pretext that what you produce
      should be applied universally, your work will transcend this historic
      ability you now have.
    - It will be important.
    - And that is the great responsibility we bear.
- Conclusion
  - Sixty years ago a wild eyed huckster spun a tale on pulp paper about a nerd
    who got bit by a radioactive spider.
  - Almost unknowingly, the tale Stan Lee told carried with it one of the great
    lessons from Western Civiliation.
  - The principal tale - that with great power comes great responsibility -
    was learned not just by a teenager from Queens but by every powerful
    contituency in human history.
  - Because of our unprecedented reach as developers, we share that
    responsibility.
  - And this weekend, and every thereafter, is another opportunity for us to
    live up to this remarkable gift we all have.
